## Description
MadridMug is the mobile application any coffee lover should have installed on their phone. Are you visiting Madrid or tired of always visiting your local cafeteria, which is perhaps not all you want? Well, MadridMug is the answer for you. Discover popular or nearby cafeterias located in Madrid, Spain. Read what other coffee drinkers think of them and make sure to leave yours as well after you've visited. But be careful! You only have 24 hours to do so after you have visited it.
